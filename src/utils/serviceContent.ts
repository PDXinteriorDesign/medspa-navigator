          question: "How long does Botox last?",
          answer: "Botox typically lasts 3-4 months, though this can vary based on factors such as the area treated, dosage used, and individual metabolism. Some patients, especially those who regularly receive Botox treatments, may find their results last longer over time."
        },
        {
          question: "Is Botox painful?",
          answer: "Most patients report minimal discomfort during Botox injections. The procedure involves using very fine needles, and many NYC MedSpas apply a topical numbing cream before treatment to enhance comfort. Some describe the sensation as a slight pinch that lasts only seconds."
        },
        {
          question: "What's the difference between Botox and fillers?",
          answer: "Botox relaxes muscles to reduce dynamic wrinkles (wrinkles caused by movement), while fillers add volume to static wrinkles and areas of lost volume. Botox is ideal for forehead lines, crow's feet, and frown lines, while fillers work best for nasolabial folds, marionette lines, and lip enhancement."
        },
        {
          question: "At what age should I start getting Botox?",
          answer: "There's no specific age to start Botox, as it depends on your individual concerns and goals. Many NYC residents begin preventative Botox in their late 20s or early 30s, while others wait until lines become more noticeable. A consultation with a qualified provider is the best way to determine if Botox is right for you."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I exercise after getting Botox?",
          answer: "It's recommended to avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours after Botox treatment. Physical activity increases blood flow, which could potentially spread the Botox to unintended areas or reduce its effectiveness at the injection site."
        }
      ];
    case "CoolSculpting":
      return [
        {
          question: "How many CoolSculpting sessions will I need?",
          answer: "Most patients need 1-3 CoolSculpting sessions per treatment area to achieve optimal results. Factors affecting this include the size of the area, the amount of fat being targeted, and your individual body's response to the treatment. During your consultation at an NYC MedSpa, your provider will create a personalized treatment plan."
        },
        {
          question: "Is CoolSculpting painful?",
          answer: "CoolSculpting isn't typically described as painful, though you may experience intense cold, pulling, tugging, and mild pinching sensations during the first few minutes of treatment. As the area numbs, these sensations generally subside. Most NYC clients read, work on laptops, or even nap during their sessions."
        },
        {
          question: "How is CoolSculpting different from liposuction?",
          answer: "CoolSculpting is a non-invasive procedure with no downtime, while liposuction is a surgical procedure requiring anesthesia and recovery time. CoolSculpting reduces fat by about 20-25% in the treated area, while liposuction can remove more fat. CoolSculpting is ideal for targeting specific pockets of fat rather than comprehensive body contouring."
        },
        {
          question: "Will I lose weight with CoolSculpting?",
          answer: "CoolSculpting is not a weight loss solution, but rather a body contouring treatment. While you likely won't see significant changes on the scale, you will notice improved body shape and fit of clothing. The procedure is designed for those at or near their ideal weight who have stubborn fat deposits resistant to diet and exercise."
        },
        {
          question: "Are CoolSculpting results permanent?",
          answer: "CoolSculpting permanently eliminates treated fat cells, which do not regenerate. However, remaining fat cells can expand with weight gain. To maintain optimal results, NYC providers recommend maintaining a stable weight through healthy diet and regular exercise."

      ];
    case "Laser Hair Removal":
      return [
        {
          question: "How many laser hair removal sessions will I need?",
          answer: "Most people require 6-8 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart for optimal results. This is because hair grows in cycles, and the laser only affects follicles in the active growth phase. Factors affecting the number of treatments include hair color, thickness, the area being treated, and your hormonal balance."
        },
        {
          question: "Is laser hair removal permanent?",
          answer: "Laser hair removal is considered a permanent hair reduction method, not complete removal. After a full treatment series, most NYC clients experience 80-90% reduction in hair growth. Occasional maintenance sessions (once or twice a year) may be needed to manage any regrowth, which is typically finer and lighter in color."
        },
        {
          question: "Does laser hair removal hurt?",
          answer: "Most people describe laser hair removal as feeling like a rubber band snap against the skin. Discomfort varies based on the treatment area, with more sensitive areas like the bikini line or upper lip being more uncomfortable. Many NYC MedSpas use cooling systems and topical numbing creams to enhance comfort during treatment."
        },
        {
          question: "Is laser hair removal safe for dark skin?",
          answer: "Yes, but it requires the right laser technology. New York City's top MedSpas offer advanced lasers like Nd:YAG that are specifically designed to safely treat darker skin tones. When performed by a skilled professional using appropriate technology, laser hair removal can be safe and effective for all skin types."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I get laser hair removal while pregnant?",
          answer: "Most medical professionals and NYC MedSpas advise against laser hair removal during pregnancy. While there's no evidence suggesting it's harmful to the baby, hormonal changes during pregnancy can affect results and may increase the risk of skin discoloration. It's recommended to wait until after pregnancy and breastfeeding to pursue treatment."
